# S397ConfigEditor

This provides a set of tabs that allow the entries in rFactor 2's Player.JSON (and LMU's Settings.JSON) to be edited.

Aims:
* Comments in file are loaded into Tooltips
* Other Tooltips added where appropriate

Currently loads c:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\rFactor 2\UserData\player\player.JSON 

Here is a (very busy) sample tab
