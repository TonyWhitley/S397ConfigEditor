# rF2_player_editor

Playing with C#, maybe this will become a set of tabs that allow the entries in rFactor 2's Player.JSON to be edited.

Aims:
* Comments in file will be loaded into Tooltips DONE
* Other Tooltips added where appropriate

Currently loads c:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\rFactor 2\UserData\player\player.JSON 

Here is a (very busy) sample tab
